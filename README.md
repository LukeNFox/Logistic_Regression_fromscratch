Task:
The goal of this assignment is to select, implement and evaluate a machine learning algorithm. You may choose any classification algorithm, whether we have covered it in lectures or not, except for k-Nearest Neighbours, Na√Øve Bayes, or rather trivial ones such as ZeroR or 1R.

You must write your own implementation from scratch, as detailed below, and compare it against a reference implementation from an open-source machine learning package.
